/*In this exercise, we will be given a url encoded string of key-value pairs, and we will have to turn it into a JavaScript object.

URL Encoded Strings
To safely send data in a URL, the data first has to be encoded to convert any special characters to URL safe characters. For this assignment we will only focus on the following URL encoding rules:

%20 represents a space character.
Key-value pairs are represented using an = character: key=value
Multiple key-value pairs are separated using a & character: key1=value1&key2=value2
So the following URL encoded string:

city=Vancouver&weather=lots%20of%20rain
Could be converted to the following JavaScript object:

{
  city: "Vancouver",
  weather: "lots of rain"
}

Instruction
Create a function named urlDecode that will receive a URL encoded string, and return the a JavaScript object that represents that data.

const urlDecode = function(text) {
  // Put your solution here
};

console.log(urlDecode("duck=rubber")); //{duck: "rubber"}
console.log(urlDecode("city=Vancouver&weather=lots%20of%20rain")); // {city: "Vancouver", weather: "lots of rain"}
console.log(urlDecode("city=Vancouver&weather=lots%20of%20rain").weather); // "lots of rain"
