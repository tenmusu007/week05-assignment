/*
In this activity, we will be converting date strings like "2017/12/02", into more English friendly date strings like December 2nd, 2017.

Talking Calendar
We will be given a date as a string (not a Date object). The date will always be formatted as YYYY/MM/DD. We will have to parse the given string and produce a human readable date.

Instruction
Create a function named talkingCalendar that takes in a date string with the format YYYY/MM/DD, and returns a new human readable date that looks like December 2nd, 2017.
*/

const talkingCalendar = function(date) {
  // Your code here
};

console.log(talkingCalendar("2017/12/02")); // December 2nd, 2017
console.log(talkingCalendar("2007/11/11")); // November 11th, 2007
console.log(talkingCalendar("1987/08/24")); // August 24th, 1987
